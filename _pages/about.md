I work on problems in AI, theoretical computer science, and economics. I enjoy applying concepts in pure mathematics (e.g. topology, differential geometry, real analysis) to solve practical problems -- specifically those that involve operating under uncertain circumstances.

Currently, I'm an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley's [Management, Engineering, and Technology program](https://met.berkeley.edu/) pursuing a dual degree (BS) in Electrical Engineering + Computer Science and Business Administration. Previously, I was a student at the [Science, Mathematics, and Computer Science Magnet Program](https://mbhs.edu/departments/magnet/about.php) at [Montgomery Blair High School](https://mbhs.edu). Since 2015, I've worked with Profs. [Aravind Srinivasan](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~srin/) and [John Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com/) on problems in market design and reinforcement learning. In 2018, I was invited to attend the [Research Science Institute](https://www.cee.org/research-science-institute) where I worked with Prof. [Scott Duke Kominers](http://scottkom.com/) in the field of matching theory. From 2016 to 2018, I worked with Prof. [William Gasarch](https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/) on the [muffin problem](https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/06/21/muffins-and-integers/), a fair-division resource allocation problem. 

My work has been recognized at the [Intel International Science and Engineering Fair](https://www.societyforscience.org/international-science-and-engineering-fair) and the [National Junior Science and Humanities Symposium](https://www.jshs.org/). I was selected as a [Regeneron STS Scholar](https://student.societyforscience.org/regeneron-sts), and most recently, I was awarded the $10,000 [ACM/CSTA Cutler-Bell Prize for High School Computing](https://awards.acm.org/cutler-bell). My work has been published in the proceedings of the [FUN 2018](https://sites.google.com/view/fun2018/) algorithms conference, and was an invited presentation at the 2018 [Joint Mathematics Meeting of the AMS and MAA](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/jmm).

Aside from my research, you can find other things that I've written on this website, including a mini-textbook on differential geometry and class notes. My other interests include piano performance and theory, computer hardware, hiking, and UAVs.
