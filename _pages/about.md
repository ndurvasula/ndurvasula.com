I'm an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley. My research interests lie broadly at the intersection of economics, optimization, and statistics. In particular, I am interested in problems relating to mechanism and market design, and I hope to develop theoretical foundations that can be readily used to improve and inform the design of real-world markets.
