I'm a second-year Ph.D student at Columbia University advised by [Tim Roughgarden](https://timroughgarden.org). I also work on mechanism design research at [Ritual](https://ritual.net). Currently, my work centers around the economic analysis of blockchain/web3 systems. In the past, I've worked on problems that broadly span computer science, economics, optimization, and statistics. 

I am very fortunate to have been advised by [Aravind Srinivasan](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~srin/), [John Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com/), [William Gasarch](https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/), [Scott Duke Kominers](http://scottkom.com/), and [Nika Haghtalab](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~nika/). 

Some of my other interests include moving around (e.g. climbing, running, hiking, swimming, etc.) and food (e.g. cooking, bread-making, cool produce, etc.). Also check out [OpenKPD](https://openkpd.org), an open-source platform for kidney exchange simulation that I developed and currently maintain.
