I'm an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley. My research interests lie broadly at the intersection of economics, optimization, and statistics. In particular, I am interested in problems relating to mechanism and market design, and I hope to develop theoretical foundations that can be readily used to improve and inform the design of real-world markets.

I am fortunate to have been advised by Professors [Aravind Srinivasan](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~srin/), [John Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com/), [William Gasarch](https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/), [Scott Duke Kominers](http://scottkom.com/), and [Nika Haghtalab](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~nika/). 

Some of my other interests include moving around (e.g. climbing, running, hiking, swimming, etc.) and food (e.g. cooking, bread-making, cool produce, etc.).
